# lilypond-web-css

Rules:

1. Copy orig/ into a new directory.  I made a copy called
   "simple".

2. Add & commit the new directory to git.

3. Edit the CSS to your heart's content.  **DO NOT** touch the
   html.

4. If you don't have your own server, get in touch with Graham to
   have your changes uploaded for discussion.
